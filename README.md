# Salifort-Motors-project
This project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

## Understand the business scenario and problem

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. 

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

### Familiarize yourself with the HR dataset 

In this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv), there are 14,999 rows, 10 columns, and these variables: 

Variable  |Description |
-----|-----| 
satisfaction_level|Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0&ndash;1]|
last_evaluation|Score of employee's last performance review [0&ndash;1]|
number_project|Number of projects employee contributes to|
average_monthly_hours|Average number of hours employee worked per month|
time_spend_company|How long the employee has been with the company (years)
Work_accident|Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work
left|Whether or not the employee left the company
promotion_last_5years|Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years
Department|The employee's department
salary|The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)

### Summary of model results

**Logistic Regression**

The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set.

**Tree-based Machine Learning**

After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model. 
### Conclusion, Recommendations, Next Steps

The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked. 

To retain employees, the following recommendations could be presented to the stakeholders:

* Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
* Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
* Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
* If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
* Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
* High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort. 

**Next Steps**

It may be justified to still have some concern about data leakage. It could be prudent to consider how predictions change when `last_evaluation` is removed from the data. It's possible that evaluations aren't performed very frequently, in which case it would be useful to be able to predict employee retention without this feature. It's also possible that the evaluation score determines whether an employee leaves or stays, in which case it could be useful to pivot and try to predict performance score. The same could be said for satisfaction score. 

For another project, you could try building a K-means model on this data and analyzing the clusters. This may yield valuable insight.
